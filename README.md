The final report summarizes the final project, which was to simulate a SQL database about a particular company (in this case, Walmart). The final report contains the following information: 
Walmart's business objectives; all entities and relationships needed for SQL database modeling; images of ERD and EER models (EER is in 3rd normal form); SQL code for database creation; and SQL code for sample queries about the database.
There is also a final presentation summarizing key aspects of the project.
